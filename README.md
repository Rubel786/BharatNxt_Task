## State Management Explanation

I have use "_MVVM_" architecture for this project. For state management I used "_Provider_" and "_setState_" both as per requirement in the app.
In main file used _MultiProvider_ for Favourites and Product card. Shared preferences for storing favourites even if we log out from the app.  We can logout from the app if back pressed on home screen.
It also had feature of Session time out using token from API after 30 minutes of using app.
